TASK 4 SALES PREDICTION USING PYTHON CodSoft

**Sales Prediction using Python**  

This project focuses on predicting future sales of a product by analyzing factors like advertising spend, target audience, and platform choice. Using machine learning in Python, the goal is to help businesses forecast sales accurately and optimize their advertising strategies.

**Project Overview**  

- **Objective**: Predict sales based on historical data and factors such as marketing spend and customer behavior.  
- **Key Steps**:  
  1. **Data Cleaning**: Prepare the sales data by handling missing values and outliers.  
  2. **Feature Creation**: Generate relevant features like ad spend, audience segmentation, and platform data.  
  3. **Model Training**: Use machine learning models (e.g., Linear Regression, Random Forest) to predict sales.  
  4. **Evaluation**: Test the model using performance metrics like MAE, RMSE, and R-squared.

**How to Run the Project**  

1. Clone the repository and navigate to the project folder.  
2. Create a virtual environment and install dependencies from `requirements.txt`.  
3. Open the Jupyter notebook `sales_prediction.ipynb` and follow the steps to run the project.

 **Project Highlights**  

- Clean and preprocess sales data for modeling.  
- Build and train a machine learning model to predict sales.  
- Evaluate the modelâ€™s accuracy to ensure reliable predictions.
